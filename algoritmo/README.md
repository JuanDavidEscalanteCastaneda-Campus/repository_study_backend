# KEEP IN MIND

* nodemon has been installed for optimal usage so install the project with `npm i`, follow the comments for each of the `npm run dev` exercises and you can see the results.

* each point at the end is recorded and saved in a commit you can see the sectioned points for later verification in the following link [commits](https://github.com/JuanDavidEscalanteCastaneda-Campus/PushUp_Duirno/commits/main)

* these challenges do not allow the use of negative numbers, they have been made literally according to the statements and their examples.

* the ways to enter the number are marked by comments, it was not done with prompt because if direct values can be used, variables can be used, so it is the same result but with a change of efficiency.

* for challenges 1 to 3 you can do them using `npm run dev` since I use node but in point 4 you will have to install the live server library and right click on the index.html file to open it by this method.
